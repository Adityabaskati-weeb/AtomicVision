# AtomicVision

**AtomicVision: An Autonomous AI Agent for Non-Destructive Multi-Defect Mapping**

AtomicVision is a hackathon-focused OpenEnv project for AI-assisted materials
characterization. It frames atomic defect mapping as a partially observable
scientific lab environment: an agent receives non-invasive vibrational spectra,
chooses characterization actions, and submits a defect map while balancing
accuracy against scan cost.

The project is moving phase by phase. Each stage is implemented only after the
previous gate has been validated.

## Current Phase

- Phase 0: Scope Lock
- Phase 1: System Design
- Phase 2: Environment Contract
- Phase 3: Synthetic Materials World
- Phase 4: Reward Scoring And Metrics
- Phase 5: OpenEnv Wrapper
- Phase 6: Baselines And Evaluation
- Phase 7: DefectNet-Lite
- Phase 8: Model Prior Training
- Phase 9: Hugging Face Space Deployment
- Phase 10: Reward Comparison And Colab Bridge
- Phase 11: GRPO Fine-Tuning Scaffold
- Phase 12: SFT Copy LoRA Rollout
- Phase 13: Format-Aware GRPO Continuation
- Status: Cost-aware assistant-masked SFT checkpoint-40 is the best promoted
  checkpoint; GRPO is now an ablation rather than the default next step

## Latest Result

Kaggle cost-aware assistant-masked SFT produced the current best Qwen3-1.7B
LoRA checkpoint. It preserves the cheap `ask_prior -> submit_defect_map`
behavior while improving reward and concentration accuracy over the prior-submit
baseline.

Promoted checkpoint: `/kaggle/working/atomicvision-cost-aware-masked-sft-lora/checkpoint-40`

| Evaluation | Episodes | Reward | F1 | MAE | Steps | Scan cost | Tool failures | Done rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cost-aware masked SFT checkpoint-40 | 32 | 4.475 | 0.791 | 0.0288 | 2.00 | 1.50 | 0.00 | 1.00 |
| GRPO-only direct rollout | 32 | 2.625 | 0.599 | 0.0783 | 2.03 | 1.55 | 0.00 | 1.00 |
| SFT-copy direct rollout | 32 | 4.458 | 0.790 | 0.0321 | 2.06 | 1.55 | 0.00 | 1.00 |
| Prior-submit baseline | 32 | 4.366 | 0.773 | 0.0318 | 2.00 | 1.50 | 0.00 | 1.00 |

The cost-aware checkpoint outperforms the deterministic prior-submit baseline
while preserving 0% malformed tool calls, 100% episode completion, and the same
low scan cost.

The first 20-step GRPO continuation from this adapter completed successfully on
Kaggle, but it was not promoted: with the required tool-system prompt it matched
the prior-submit baseline (`4.366` reward, `0.773` F1) and remained below the
SFT-copy adapter. A follow-up format-aware smoke also produced valid tool calls
but logged `reward_std=0`, `frac_reward_zero_std=1`, `loss=0`, and
`grad_norm=0`, confirming that grouped rollouts had no relative reward signal.
The GRPO scaffold remains available, but it is no longer the default next step.
GRPO should be treated as a controlled ablation because the promoted
cost-aware SFT checkpoint already beats the baseline and previous GRPO attempts
risked zero-variance or behavior regression.
