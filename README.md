# AtomicVision

**AtomicVision: An Autonomous AI Agent for Non-Destructive Multi-Defect Mapping**

AtomicVision is a hackathon-focused OpenEnv project for AI-assisted materials
characterization. It frames atomic defect mapping as a partially observable
scientific lab environment: an agent receives non-invasive vibrational spectra,
chooses characterization actions, and submits a defect map while balancing
accuracy against scan cost.

The project is moving phase by phase. Each stage is implemented only after the
previous gate has been validated.

## Current Gate Status

AtomicVision is now in a verifier-hardening phase before GRPO. The current
question is not "can we train another adapter?" but "can the trained adapter
reliably emit valid tool calls on held-out seeds?"

Current status:

- Stable environment: yes
- Stable NaN-safe SFT path: yes
- Held-out strict tool-call gate: blocked
- Official normalized held-out eval path: implemented
- GRPO readiness: not yet

The project now tracks both:

- **strict execution**: the model must emit one exact JSON tool call
- **normalized execution**: near-miss outputs are canonicalized for diagnosis

This split makes it much easier to tell whether a failure is:

- policy quality
- tool-call formatting
- or a reward / execution mismatch

## Best Demo Result

The best current in-distribution demo result is still the cost-aware masked SFT
checkpoint-40 on medium episodes. That result is useful for the demo package,
but it is **not** yet the final held-out promotion bar.

| Evaluation | Episodes | Reward | F1 | MAE | Steps | Scan cost | Tool failures | Done rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cost-aware masked SFT checkpoint-40 | 32 | 4.475 | 0.791 | 0.0288 | 2.00 | 1.50 | 0.00 | 1.00 |
| GRPO-only direct rollout | 32 | 2.625 | 0.599 | 0.0783 | 2.03 | 1.55 | 0.00 | 1.00 |
| SFT-copy direct rollout | 32 | 4.458 | 0.790 | 0.0321 | 2.06 | 1.55 | 0.00 | 1.00 |
| Prior-submit baseline | 32 | 4.366 | 0.773 | 0.0318 | 2.00 | 1.50 | 0.00 | 1.00 |

## Held-Out Verifier Columns

The official adapter evaluator now reports:

- `strict_tool_call_pass_rate`
- `normalized_tool_call_pass_rate`
- `normalized_tool_call_repair_rate`
- `first_action_valid_rate`
- `first_action_ask_prior_rate`
- `submit_action_rate`
- `done_rate`
- `tool_failure_rate`

This is the current reliability gate before GRPO. A model that only looks good
on reward but fails these verifier columns is not considered ready.

## Next Training Gate

The next promotion order is:

1. run strict + normalized held-out eval with `training/evaluate_atomicvision_adapter.py`
2. confirm non-zero success on held-out seeds
3. only then run `cost-aware-variance-probe`
4. only then run short GRPO continuation

The earlier 20-step GRPO continuation completed successfully on Kaggle, but it
was not promoted. More importantly, later held-out recovery runs showed that
tool-call formatting can still collapse even when training loss looks healthy.
That is why verifier columns are now treated as first-class gates rather than
optional diagnostics.
